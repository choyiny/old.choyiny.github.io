Introduction
------------
This Github Pages is used to experiment features that can be added to my personal site, [choy.in](http://choy.in). This Github Page acts as a sandbox and will be used to test new features that can be added to the live site.

This site may be a **LIVE** site soon, due to the high amount of visitors it can handle simultaneously.

The purpose of this readme is to act as a template for my future projects.
